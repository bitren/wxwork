    <string name="apw">Solutions</string>
    <string name="apx">"1. Inaccurate \"Current Location\"? nTo ensure high location accuracy, allow WeChat Work to access your location information.
If it is still inaccurate, try disable and re-enable the mobile GPS to reset the location information.
You can improve the location accuracy by turning on WiFi and Bluetooth (no connection required). n
2. Wrong \"Punch Location\"？ nPunch location and range are preset by company admin.
If the company has multiple punch locations, the one closest to you will be displayed first.
In case of location missing or deviation, contact company admin to modify the location, expand punch range, or enable punch in/out over WiFi. n
3. Any other problems? nIf you have any other problems, contact us at \"WeChat Work\" - \"Me\" - \"Settings\" - \"Online Service\""</string>
    <string name="apy"><b>1. Current Location is incorrect. </b>"
To ensure an accurate positioning, you need to allow WeChat Work to access your location information in the system settings, and enable the positioning feature;
Stay in an open area with better positioning signal;
Enabling WiFi and Bluetooth (without connection) allows a more accurate positioning. If the problem persists, disable the mobile positioning service and then enable it again, or restart WeChat Work and the phone to get the location information again. n
"<b>2. Punch Rule is incorrect. </b>"
Contact the admin to verify whether the rule name is correct. This is probably because of multiple duplicate rules or an incorrect rule. Modification is required to ensure the punch member is correct. n
"<b>3. Punch Location is incorrect. </b>"
Punch Location and Punch Area are preset by admin.
If multiple punch locations were set, the one closest to you is displayed first.
If the punch location does not exist or is incorrect, contact the admin to modify the location, expand punch area, or enable WiFi-based punch. n
"<b>4. The problem persists despite of all the solutions above. </b>"
If the problem persists, contact us by going to \"WeChat Work - Me - Settings - Feedback\"."</string>

 This is often caused by the missed setting of BSSID. If there are multiple Wi-Fis with the same name, be sure to add BSSIDs for all the Wi-Fis. For some Wi-Fis, BSSID changes with the restart of Wi-Fi. You need to set the changed BSSID in the punch rule.

3. Other reasons

If the problem persists and your Wi-Fi has a large coverage, contact Wi-Fi technician to verify whether the BSSID is dynamic.
